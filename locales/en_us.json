        "p1" : "I'm a Neovim enthusiast and tab advocate, finding unparalleled efficiency in Vim's keyboard commands and the flexibility of tabs for personal viewing preferences. This extends to my support for static typing, where its early error detection ensures cleaner code, and my preference for dark mode, which eases long coding sessions by reducing eye strain."
